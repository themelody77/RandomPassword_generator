# Password Generator  
This is a simple Python script that generates random passwords. The script utilizes the string and random modules to generate passwords containing a combination of digits, punctuation marks, and ASCII letters.


## Usage  
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.  
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.  
  
cd path/to/password-generator  
  
Run the script by executing the following command:  
python Main.py  
  
Enter the desired length of the password when prompted.  
The script will generate a random password using the specified length and display it on the screen.  
  
## Example  
Here's an example of how to use the password generator:  
Enter the length of the password: 12  
Suggested password: k5!QjL+*g9x  
In this case, a password of length 12, containing digits, punctuation marks, and ASCII letters, is generated.
